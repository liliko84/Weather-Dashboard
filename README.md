# Weather-Dashboard

My weather dashboard html file is mostly bootstrap with rows and columns , which meets all the requirements ( big screen and the phone).it has the search input and the minute wi clik on it displays the weather for the particulad city, afterwards adds it to the page as a row, all that was added through jquery, first by creating variables and then function to search for it .
After we have the variable with the weather api urs and api key,ajax call and the function tu get all the neccessary information from the page.
Then we created the city array looped through it and addeds the user input button to add it to the page.Then we needed to get addition url to get UV index and at the end display 5 day forcast of the city the user was searching for.
